# Execution environments

## Native Windows

Settings > Execution environment contains the global Windows Shell preference. Automatic selection prefers PowerShell 7 (`pwsh.exe`), then built-in Windows PowerShell 5.1 when PowerShell 7 is absent. Explicit PowerShell 7, Windows PowerShell and Git Bash choices do not switch to another shell on failure. Git Bash can use a custom executable path. The WSL launcher `System32/bash.exe` is not a Git Bash candidate.

PowerShell user scripts are passed as temporary UTF-8 BOM `.ps1` files, with no profile and UTF-8 output. The temporary file is removed after execution. The script-file transport avoids the Windows command-line length limit and preserves Unicode, quotes and multiline text. Process-scoped execution policy allows this generated script; machine policy is not changed. Native executable exit codes should be reported explicitly using `$LASTEXITCODE`.

## Explicit WSL projects

Open the project menu > Manage workspace > Runtime shell. Choose WSL, name the distribution and specify the Linux package's `deepcode-kernel` executable installed inside it, for example `/opt/deepcode/deepcode-kernel` (an absolute path or a command on that distribution's PATH). Set this field to the actual installed executable. Use a Linux package built from the current implementation; a Windows `.exe` cannot be used as the Linux worker.

Workspace filesystem tools and Bash execute in a single-invocation Linux Kernel worker through `wsl.exe --distribution ... --exec ... --kernel-tool-worker`. The worker does not create a Session, start a Provider, open a service port or write a second journal. The Windows Host and shared Session continue to own conversation identity, Plan admission, tool records and progress. Native Windows paths are translated using `wslpath`; a WSL UNC project must belong to the selected distribution. Output archives remain in the Session-owned storage directory.

The distribution, Kernel executable and project files must already be available. An unavailable worker or invalid project path is reported as an error; DeepCode does not install a distribution, move files or switch to native execution automatically.

## Stable context

Each new run captures the selected operating system, architecture, locale, shell and command search path. A running or restored run keeps its prepared facts. On macOS, the Host reads PATH from the user's login shell at initialization or explicit environment refresh; tool invocations do not reload profiles. Discovery and execution use that same prepared PATH. Windows and WSL use the selected execution endpoint's environment.

Execution target, project build requirements and sandbox permissions are separate. Read project files to identify the build/test environment; a native shell may invoke Docker for a Linux build. `commandPaths` records commands found on `executionPath`, not an inventory of installed software. A missing command, sandbox denial or unreachable socket cannot establish that the host lacks a tool or a service is stopped. The Kernel selects Shell permissions from the approved Plan, user settings and call approval, not model input. Host permission changes access, not the selected target, shell or prepared PATH. Required approval happens before execution; the Kernel does not retry failed commands automatically. Service readiness is checked on demand in the intended scope.

## Workspace Shell

Shell selection and workspace isolation are separate capabilities. macOS uses sandbox-exec. Linux and WSL2 use Bubblewrap; the Linux package includes its helper. A system installation needs the `bubblewrap` package and permission to create user, mount, PID and network namespaces. WSL1 does not provide these namespaces. Container policies may restrict them even when Bubblewrap is installed.

The native Windows restricted-token backend does not provide the required read isolation. Use an explicitly selected WSL2 environment for workspace Shell, or explicitly authorize Host execution. Initialization alone does not change this boundary.

Project files are read-only to workspace Shell, even when file-tool editing is allowed. Edit and delete project files through the file tools and the current Plan. Plan `writablePaths` grants test/output directories, including writing and removing their contents; it does not classify the commands inside them. Project-root and individual project-file Shell grants are rejected. Session working directories remain writable for probes and build results. Each Shell call also has its own TMPDIR/TMP/TEMP directory, removed after that call; use the session workspace for files needed later.

Workspace Shell is offline by default. `requestNetworkPermission` requests network access for the prepared environment without broadening file writes. The approval can last for one operation, the current task (`runId`) or the conversation (`sessionId`). Network tools retain their separate network-read setting. Existing explicit command deny/ask rules still apply.

Shell approval and execution scope are separate settings. Ask waits for the user; Review invokes an independent context with no tools; Allow uses the permitted environment without further Shell review. A delegated reviewer can only accept or reject the Kernel's proposed scope and lifetime, not invent a grant. Authorized subsequent calls reuse that grant without invoking the reviewer again. Changing relevant permission settings or revoking a grant takes effect before the next execution.

The GUI's primary approval is “Allow this turn”; “Allow this conversation” is available on the left. Both apply to the environment or files named in the request. Explicit per-call rules offer only “Allow” for that operation. The browser retains its conversation-level approval. CLI and TUI use the same Kernel scopes through their text choices.

Explicit Host execution uses the host user's real permissions, including writes outside the project sandbox. Its approval can cover the exact command or the Host environment for this task/conversation. A working directory is not an isolation boundary. Core tools preserve the original command, approved target, authority, output and actual exit status; scripts and their children belong to the same invocation. There is no keyword-based proof of script effects or automatic retry with more authority.

## Docker test environments

Select the Containers plugin to inspect or execute in a particular Linux container, or create a temporary test container. The Kernel resolves the Docker context and full container ID before approval. Task and conversation grants bind that target; reusing a name for a different container requires another grant. The plugin uses the same execution archive, cancellation and Session projection as the other tools, and does not add a second Agent Loop.

A temporary test container mounts the selected project read-only at `/project` and a separate session directory at `/work`. Copy project files into `/work` when a build writes into its source tree. Choose the project's Docker network for multi-container tests, or `none` for offline work. Creation approval covers use and eventual cleanup. Only containers created by this plugin are removed at release; outputs retained in the session directory remain available to file tools and the file tree.

Existing development containers keep their users, mounts, capabilities and network. Granting access to one does not make its writable project mounts read-only. Keep reusable configuration in the project's Docker/Compose files; saved configuration is not an access grant. Arbitrary Docker commands through Host Shell still require Host authority. Linux images need `/bin/sh` and `setsid` for command-group cancellation. Docker must be available in the prepared execution PATH. The plugin does not start or replace the user's Docker service.

`doc.read` returns bundled English Markdown describing the product. `skill.read` returns workflow guidance for a relevant task. Plugins settings lists text Skills and their sources; documentation is not listed as an executable plugin or a Skill.
